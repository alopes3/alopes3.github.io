          <p>THe Pacific Northwest is home to many different bird species. SOme are large and some are small.</p>

            <p>This ecoregion includes most of the Olympic Peninsula (but not its northern and eastern coastal plain),
              the lowlands of the Chehalis River drainage and around Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay, the Willapa Hills, a
              nd coastal waters out to three miles offshore on the outer coast and out to the international boundary on
              the Strait of Juan de Fuca west of the mouth of the Twin Rivers. It is bordered on the east by the Puget
              Trough lowlands, and on the south by the Columbia River. The ecoregion itself extends north to Vancouver
              Island and south through much of the Coast Ranges of Oregon.</p>

              <p>Cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers characterize the ecoregion, and the west side of the Olympics
                is the wettest part of the state, large areas receiving more than 150 inches of rain in an average year,
                locally over 200 inches. Coastal lowlands receive much less precipitation (e.g., 84 inches at Aberdeen)
                but are still very wet. Snow blankets the Olympics with accumulations up to 10 feet or more and persists
                 at higher elevations into mid-summer (although only episodic in the lowland winters), and the higher peaks
                 have permanent glaciers. The southern end of the ecoregion is distinctly warmer than the northern end,
                 spring arriving perceptibly earlier. With prevailing southwesterly winds dropping most of their moisture
                 on west slopes, the northeastern corner of the region is in a distinct rain shadow, the annual precipitation
                  declining dramatically toward the coastal lowlands.</p>
