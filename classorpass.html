    <h1>Bad Website: Craigslist</h1>
    <p>

    Craigslist is an ugly and outdated website. I have the feeling that as soon as I log onto this website I'm guaranteed to encounter a drug dealer or find the address to some perverted killer.
    While the text and code is simple, sufficient, and clean, with appropriate lists, tables, links, etc, it could certainly use an update and some charm. I could understand the appeal of a bare-bones layout in order to keep casual transactions between people less complicated, however it could avoid looking like a shady flea market-esque website. The use of simple gray and white backgrounds, black texts, and blue links keeps it simple, but looks like something made in a computer science class. The purple peace symbol in the head doesnâ€™t make sense with the website name and looks gaudy. Overall simple design. I would not make any transaction on this site.

    <h1> Good Website One: YouTube </h1>

    YouTube has a simple and efficient website. Its simplistic yet clean appeal can encourage users to spend hours on their website with its trustworthy, welcoming design. Text and code is very simple, mostly providing links and images to videos, and tables separating videos into categories, such as recommended, watch later, and featured. One criticism I do have is that it webpages can feel a little too cluttered, and YouTube is begging you to spend as much time as possible on their site and throws every kind of video you could possibly be interested in at one, almost in a creepy way. The colors are simple, with balck, white, and a red logo that fits the company name and function. Overall clean design. I trust YouTube when watching videos.

    <h1>Good Website Two; Orvis</h1>

    Orvis presents a simple and friendly design to encourage customers to buy their clothing. Text is simple, and the code appears to include lots of apple-touch-icons designed for users to access while on an iPhone. This is apparent with the amount of awkward scrolling you have to do on the homepage and several pop-ups appearing that look more in place on a vertically displayed screen. Despite this, the website still looks clean. Simple greens, whites, and blacks fill the page, and splashes of color are presented with pictures of hikers, hunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Product pictures are clear and clean, and neatly organized in different tables and categories. Orvis has done a great job presenting its merchandise and welcoming users.
