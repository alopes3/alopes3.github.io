          <p>The two living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey geese and white geese, such as the greylag goose and snow goose, and Branta, black geese, such as the Canada goose.</p>

          <p>Two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren goose, and Cnemiornis,
            the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese.</p>

            <p>Fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many
              different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named Anser atavus (meaning "progenitor goose") from some 12
              million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

              <p>Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short
                 nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.</p>

                <p>Geese honk while in flight to encourage other members of the flock to maintain a 'v-formation' and to help communicate with one another.</p>

            <p> IF you ever get in a fight with a goose and it manages to survive, please take it to a nearby bird sanctuary! Below is a sanctury I vist regularly with geese I've wounded.</p>
