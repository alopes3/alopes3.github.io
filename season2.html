        <h1>Welcome to Hell</h1>

        <p><img src="food.jpg" alt="Bird" title="Yummy" class="yessir">This isn't what you were expecting, was it? Sure, the food may not look like much,
        but it'll keep you alive! Your chicken may look a bit pink but that's okay. COlorful food is healthier! There's always other options, like vegan 
          soup and cardboard pizz. But hey, maybe tomorrow's food will be better!</p>

        <p>If you have any food alergies or sensitivites, worry not! Carroll offers a gluten-free section with flavorless doughnuts, and soy milk for vegans who want
          that extra estrogen in their diet. If you have a poor pallete, then the STAC is the place for you.</p>

        <p>Don't be foolish enough to try and opt out of eating this food. Carroll requires that you pay thousands of dollars, at $10 a meal, for this stuff.</p>
