    <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h1>
    <p>Alaska is cool. There are lots of pictures of lakes and nature. There is even a readily-avilable tab for visiters who want to travel ot this awesome state. Under the "Licenses and Permits" section there is a charming young lady holding a ram she had just recently shot, provign this webpage has the gusto to know its market of hunters and outdoorsmen.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></h1>
    <p>The first thing I was greeted with was a cool picture of a rocket preparing to blast into orbit. The home page is very very basic, which is nice. It's like an intorductory paragraph, with very little information or features, but it's there to get the job done and welcome you. Very classy.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a></h1>
    <p>Clean style, with a neat picture of a town in the backgorund. There are even tweets from the offical Nebraska twitter page, so it hows the political big wigs are hip with the kids. I also like how when you hover over the bar on top of the pge all the different options show, not just the options for the indiviudal word. The page itself is kind of dull and the ony color being a large pie chart I don't really care about.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a></h1>
    <p>Webpage is quite dull with ugly pop-ups. There really nothing interesting about the page. At to bottom you can see pictures of all the stooges who make Deleware a boring state. Not a cool feautre forth having when intorducing people to your state website.
      </p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois</a></h1>
    <p>Illinois sucks (not my opinion, just the way it is). Webpage is quite similar to Delaware's but worse. The only major splash of color is a large red banner telling me ot get vaccinated and an ugly yellow banner at the very top pleading for five year olds to et vaccinated. Under the "Popular Service" section there is a link to "Certify Weekly Unemployment Beneftts" information. Typical for Illinois to have that as a popular service. All the guy's haircut on the picture sucks.</p>
